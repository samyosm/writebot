# Using Writebot

There is two ways of using Writebot, you can either use a preset object, or you could use a preset name.
In any case, before using Writebot, you would have to initialize it with an API Key from openai and optionally your preset objects.

## Initializing

Initializing Writebot is done using the initialize method like such:

```typescript
const { Writebot } = require('writebot');

Writebot.initialize({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Insert your API Key here.
});
```

If you are planning on calling your presets by their name instead of their objects, you must also initialize Writebot with the presets' objects like so:

```typescript
const { Writebot } = require('writebot');

Writebot.initialize({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Insert your API Key here.
  presets: [
    require('tweet-gen'),
    require('youtube-comment-gen')
  ]
});
```

## Basic generation

### Passing the preset object

If you don't call Writebot dynamically, i.e. you are always calling the same preset, you can pass the preset object to Writebot directly like so:

```typescript
const { Writebot } = require('writebot');
const TweetGen = require('tweet-gen');

Writebot.initialize({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Insert your API Key here.
});

Writebot.write(TweetGen, {
  description: 'A tweet about AIs',
  tone: 'Afraid'
});
```

The `write` function will return a promise with openai's response. Here is how you can get the text:

```javascript
const tweetResponse =  Writebot.write(TweetGen, {
  description: 'A tweet about AIs',
  tone: 'Afraid'
});

tweetResponse
  .then(response => console.log(response.data.choices[0].text)); // This will log the tweet.
```

### Passing the preset name

If you do call Writebot dynamically, i.e. you aren't calling the same preset, you can pass the preset name to Writebot directly like so:

```typescript
const { Writebot } = require('writebot');
const TweetGen = require('tweet-gen');

Writebot.initialize({
  apiKey: API_KEY, // Insert your API Key here.,
  presets: [
    TweetGen,
  ]
});

Writebot.write('tweet-gen', {
  description: 'A tweet about AIs',
  tone: 'Afraid'
});
```
