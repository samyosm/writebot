# What is a preset?

The preset is the query maker for Writebot.

Writebot's job is to send a query to GPT-3 and give you the answer. A preset's job is to make the query Writebot will send.
It will achieve this using the params you will provide them. Because it is important that a preset receives the good parameter, before making
the query, Writebot will ensure the parameter received are the one the preset wants.

Writebot will know what the right parameters are by validating the parameters using a validation library called [superstruct](https://docs.superstructjs.org).

Furthermore, Writebot has the feature of being able to call a preset using its name. That name is provided in a config object alongside the params object.

At the end, a preset is made of three things:
- A `config` object with the preset's name and `params` object.
- A `params` object to validate parameter.
- A `makeQuery` function that makes the query.

## Config

The config object is a very simple object with only two elements in it: the preset's name and the params. Below is an example.

```javascript
const config = {
    preset: 'movie-review-gen',
    params // The param object described below
}
```

## Params

The `params` object has the job of specifying structure of the parameters `makeQuery` will need. For example, if `makeQuery` needs a tone, and a movie title to make the query,
the params object might look something like this:

```typescript
import { object, string } from 'superstruct';

const params = object({
  tone: string(),
  movieTitle: string(),
});
```

## Make query

The `makeQuery` function has the job of making the query from the parameters received. In the case above, to make a movie review query, it could look like this:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs
    defaultValue="javascript"
    values={[
        {label: 'Javascript', value: 'javascript'},
        {label: 'Typescript', value: 'typescript'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="javascript">
```

```javascript
const makeQuery = ({ tone, movieTitle }) => {
  return `
  Generate a simple movie review for the movie title ${movieTitle} using the following tone ${tone}.
  `;
};
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">
```

```typescript
import { Infer } from 'superstruct';

const makeQuery = ({ tone, movieTitle }: Infer<typeof params>) => {
  return `
  Generate a simple movie review for the movie title ${movieTitle} using the following tone ${tone}.
  `;
};
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
