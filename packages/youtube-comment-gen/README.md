## Params

Youtube-comment-gen allows you to create simple youtube comment from
- a `videoTitle`,
- a `description`, and
- a `tone`.

| Parameter   | Type   | Information                                     |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| videoTitle  | String | The title of the video you want a comment on    |
| description | String | Describe what you want the comment to be about  |
| tone        | String | Specify the attitude or feeling of the comment. |

## Example

```typescript title="Request"
const { Writebot } = require('writebot');
const YoutubeCommentGen = require('youtube-comment-gen');

Writebot.initialize({
  apiKey: API_KEY,
});

Writebot.write(YoutubeCommentGen, {
  videoTitle: 'Huawei Just Overtook Apple. Time For Phase 2.',
  description: 'A comment of a user who find the video poorly worked on.',
  tone: 'Deceived'
}).then((e: any) => console.log(e.data.choices[0].text));
```
```textmate title="Result"
This video is incredibly misleading. It implies that Huawei is now in some kind of position of dominance, when in reality it's still a long way from overtaking Apple. Poorly done.
```
